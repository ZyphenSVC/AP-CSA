for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
{
    putBall();
}
```

> 107

### Question 15
#### Which of these code snippets would be the best implementation of a method called moveToWall() which moves Karel to the end of a row in the current direction?

> ```java
> while(frontIsClear())
> {
>     move();
> }
> ```

### Question 16
#### If Karel is not on a tennis ball, and all directions around are clear:

> }
>```

### Question 18

```java
if(<CONDITION>)
{
    turnLeft();
}
else
{
    move();
}
```

> frontIsBlocked()

### Question 19
#### Say you want to write a program to have Karel put down 300 tennis balls. Which control structure would you use?

> A for loop

### Question 20
#### Say you want to write a program to have Karel pick up all of the tennis balls in a location, but you donâ€™t know how many tennis balls there are. Which control structure would you use?

> A while loop

### Question 21
#### What is a condition in Karel programming?

> A method that returns a true or false answer. Typically used within a control structure.

### Question 22
#### What is wrong with the style of this method declaration?

```java
private void spinKarel() {
turnLeft();
turnLeft();
turnLeft();
turnLeft();
}
```
```
(I) Indenting is wrong

(II) No comment

(III) Not using camelCasing for name

(IV) Brackets are not on their own line
```

> I, II, and IV

### Question 23
#### What is wrong with this method declaration?

```java
public karelDance()
[
    move();
    turnLeft();
    move();
    turnLeft();
    move();
]
```
```
(I) Not using curly brackets

(II) Missing void

(III) The method should start with a capital. i.e. KarelDance

(IV) Illegal characters in the method name
```

> I and II

### Question 24
